# carbon-chart-angular-issue
problem with rxjs version

I used node v. 16.14.1 as it is recommended in carbon-chart-angular library.
Carbon-chart-angular v. 1.0.1 (exact).
Angular version 13.3.11 (latest).

NPM install must be run either with `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`.
Either of flag is resulting that the css is breaking and e.g. the options in upper right corners for the donut chart are not working properly.
